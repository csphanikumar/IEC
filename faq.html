                                <p>Ethics approval is crucial for all research, including qualitative studies. While a qualitative study may involve some flexibility in how questions are phrased during the interview, a well-developed plan is still essential.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />1. The ethics committee needs to understand the overall research goals, interview topics, and potential risks to participants. Minor adjustments to wording or phrasing to improve comprehension are expected and don't require an amendment to your protocol.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />2. However, if the changes you make are significant and affect the core aspects of your research, like purpose, hypothesis, or key interview questions, it's important to submit an amendment to your approved protocol with the ethics committee.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />If you're unsure whether a change requires an amendment, don't hesitate to contact the ethics committee office. They can provide guidance and help you navigate the process if contacted in a time-bound manner.</p>

However, this timeframe may vary depending on the project's complexity and the committee's workload. The ethics committee is scheduled to meet every month in the third week. You should submit the application before the 5th of the month to be considered for the upcoming ethics committee review (end of the month). You are advised to prepare your application well in time and take 2 months to turn around the cycle for your application.</p>

                                    <br />1. It should be simple language for the participant to understand.
                                    <br />2. It should be in a language the participant can understand.
                                    <br />3. If the participant is illiterate, then oral consent can be obtained, i.e., the interviewer reads out the PIS and seeks oral confirmation for participation. Audio recording of the oral consent must be stored for verification.
                                    <br />4. A copy of informed consent signed by the participant and interviewer should be provided to the participant.
                                    <br />5. The privacy of the participant must be protected and raw data identifying the participant should be only with the principal investigator or co-principal investigators.
                                    <br />6. Tentative time required from the participant should be mentioned in the PIS
                                    <br />7. Any kind of financial inducement for the study participant is not recommended, only time and travel compensation are permissible. In the past, the studies compensating participants up to 150 – 200 Rs/hr. have been approved. This information should be included in the PIS.
                                    <br />8. If the participants are from a particular organization, appropriate approval from the representative is required to conduct the study.
                                    <br />9. PI are advised to avoid recruiting participants who are the students enrolled in the courses, this helps in retaining participant’s freedom to not participate in the research.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />For surveys, interviews and qualitative ethnographic studies.
                                    <br />1. A list of questionnaires should be submitted along with the application.
                                    <br />2. If the questionnaire is part of a known study protocol, it should be referenced and provided in the application. Advisable to attach author’s permission to use the material and ensure there is no copy right violations.
                                    <br />3. In case of ethnographic studies, list of questions and topics, variables/themes to be covered should be provided in the application. It is advised that this list of questions, themes, variables, constructs are related to the research hypothesis, and questions. This ensures that the participant’s time is utilized in a suitable manner.

                                <p>Firstly, Check the terms of use and data privacy policies of the social media platform where you're collecting data. Some platforms may restrict certain types of research.Secondly, employ robust anonymization techniques to ensure data cannot be re-identified back to individual participants.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />1. Even without individual consent, seeking ethical approval for your research is crucial. Ethics committees can help you navigate the complexities of using non-consented data and ensure your study minimizes risks to participants.

                                <p>Here are the best practices when working with participants from vulnerable groups, along with the justification based on the ICMR guidelines from 2017:
                                    <br />
                                    <br />1. Justification for Inclusion: Researchers need to clearly explain why it's necessary to involve vulnerable populations in the research. This justification ensures that the potential benefits of the research outweigh any risks or burdens for these participants.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />2. Informed Consent: The informed consent process for vulnerable populations should be adapted to their specific needs and understanding. This may involve using simpler language, providing additional information sheets, or involving a trusted intermediary to explain the research in a culturally appropriate manner.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />3. Training and Cultural Competence: Ensure researchers and staff working with vulnerable participants receive training on ethical considerations, cultural competence, and sensitivity. This training helps them understand and navigate the unique challenges and needs of vulnerable populations.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />4. Handle Sensitive Topics Carefully: Handle sensitive topics with care and respect for cultural sensitivities. Use appropriate language and methods to collect data without causing distress to participants.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />5. Include Distress Protocol: Incorporate a distress protocol into your research proposal. This protocol outlines steps to be taken if a participant from a vulnerable group experiences distress during the study, ensuring their well-being is prioritized.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />The justification for these best practices can be found in Section 6 of the ICMR guidelines from 2017, which provides detailed guidance on research involving vulnerable populations. This section emphasizes the need for additional safeguards, adapted consent processes, cultural sensitivity, and justification for including vulnerable participants in research studies.

                                <p>1. Clear and Accessible Information: The informed consent document should be clear, concise, and accessible to participants. This might involve offering different formats (e.g., online document, downloadable PDF) and using easy-to-understand language.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />2. Online Consent Process: Ensure the online consent process is user-friendly, and participants can easily understand what they're agreeing to. This could involve including options to review information and ask questions before consenting.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />3. Implement strong data security measures to protect participant information collected online. This might involve encryption, password protection, and secure storage practices.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />4. Data Minimization: Collect only the data that is essential for research study. Avoid collecting unnecessary personal information.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />5. Transparency about Data Use: Clearly explain to participants how their data will be used, stored, and shared in the informed consent document. Offer options for participants to withdraw their data if they wish.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />Depending on the specific nature of your research, you may need to consider additional ethical issues. If you have any doubts, consult with an ethics committee or a professional familiar with research ethics.
